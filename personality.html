  <h2>Myers-Briggs Test Results - Advocate (INFJ-A)</h2>
  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">
    <img src="briggs.jpg" alt="Myers-Briggs Test Results" width="800"></a>
  <p>The results for this test identify me as the type that is able to identify
    the motives of others and defuse conflict effectively, and operates with
    strong ethics. The Advocate personality will occasionally need their own
    time as well due to being of an introverted nature, and are not comfortable
    working with people less ethically inclined.</p>
  <h2>Hermann Brain Dominance Instrument - 1121</h2>

    <img src="hbdi.png" alt="HBDI Profile" width="800"></a>
  <p>I took part in this paid test as part of a leadership training program in
    a previous work role. The test defines four quadrants of your brain and the
    degree of which you use it. My result shows that I have a relatively balanced
    load between the quadrants, but slightly favour the Analytical quadrant,
    which focuses on facts, critical thinking, and logic.</p>
  <h2>Learning Style Test Results - Solitary Dominant </h2>

  <p>This test shows that I would likely be most comfortable in solitary study...
    Which I suppose is really, really lucky right now.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Taking these results with a grain of salt, I agree with most of the
    details that are presented. What I do take away from these are insights into
    how I may be perceived by others, so in that regard I think there is real
    value to be found. The results wouldn’t really change my behaviour in a team
    environment, I’m very comfortable working with new people and am used to
    the challenges and conflicts that can come with the scenario.
    When forming a team, I am happy to work with anyone that is willing to
    put in the effort to support the team accordingly.</p>
  <p>With that said, I respect proactive team members who are willing to put
    in the time and effort to create something meaningful, and I'm always
    looking for a way to help them accomplish that.</p>
