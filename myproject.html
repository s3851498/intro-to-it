  <h1>My Project - Virtual Reality Training Programs</h1>
  <p>I am very interested in the implementation of virtual reality in education,
    so I would like to propose a project surrounding VR as a teaching tool for
    my first project. I would like to produce a suite of applications that are
    designed to provide a hands-on approach to the techniques and abilities that
    are greatly sought after in the country’s industries. The goal of the project
    is to broaden the talent pool of Australian students as they leave school by
    promoting and encouraging trades through virtual representation.</p>
  <p>I believe the education system in Australia is capable of being more
    effective and compelling in the future with virtual reality in its toolset.
    It would provide a new and engaging method of learning for its students,
    leading to greater interest in professions that our youths may otherwise not
    have known or care about. I previously worked in infrastructure, where I
    noticed the lack of available talent in field workers and the like. I would
    like to hope that there are people in schools growing up might be fantastic
    and in love with this kind of work but not even know it exists. In the same
    way that personal computers reshaped the classroom, I hope to see virtual
    reality come through as the future of modern schooling.</p>
  <p>This suite of applications would feature multiple practical training
    exercises in manual skills and trades, as well as scenarios built off case
    studies of real-world problems. It would be optimised to run on lower
    powered machines to keep the hardware cost within public schooling budgets
    and aim to be as approachable and affordable as possible. It would also be
    pertinent to make the software compatible with all available hardware
    options (as in Oculus Rifts, HTC Vives, Windows Mixed Reality Headsets, etc)
    in case a certain headset is declared a standard in the potential future.</p>
  <p>The inbuilt curriculum could be organised with industry standards and the
    Australian Government’s Department of Education, Skills and Employment to
    target workforces with skill shortages. Updatability will be important so
    that it can be changed when necessary. The hook for this application would
    be having actual industry leaders advising on the curriculum as well so that
    we can ensure the relevance to the real-life work.</p>
  <p>I would personally like to see a lot of emphasis placed into medical fields,
    as it would be able to simulate difficult or dangerous procedures in a
    controlled and safe environment. But virtual reality could also be
    beneficial for things like mechanical and electrical engineering, aviation,
    architectural professions, emergency services, and planning. The simulations
    should be as true to life as is practicable, while also taking advantage of
    the fantastical nature of the platform to help motivate students in taking
    an interest in the field. Imagine: being able to learn how to pilot a
    Boeing 747 from your classroom when you’re seventeen; learning how to
    produce new medicines in a virtual laboratory; teaching children the skills
    that can save a life in an emergency.</p>
  <p>Preferably the applications would be given consideration as a government
    initiative, in order to provide the technology and experience to every
    school possible. Alternatively, I would consider approaching industry
    leaders to see if they would be interested in investing in the idea, but I
    would rather avoid privatisation for moral reasons. I believe the initiative
    to train and promote Australia’s industry to be extremely beneficial to our
    country and the world as a whole, and I think reaching the outcome I would
    like will require a financial independence.</p>
  <p>To produce the applications, I would first have to complete the coding and
    design. At this stage I don’t know a lot about different platforms and
    languages, not enough to make a solid answer to how this would best be
    actioned, but I would consider building this in the same manner video games
    are built, as the experience is presented in a similar way. Using game
    engines like Unity or Unreal could be a good direction to go. The systems
    and resources available are plentiful, and it should be easier to find
    talent that is already comfortable with the engines.</p>
  <p>In terms of skills required to make the project work, I would need to be
    far more knowledgeable of programming and software design and would then
    need to learn more about the techniques I’d like the program to teach.
    Hardware-wise, I don’t believe there would be any trouble if my desire for
    compatibility is possible, so I think it would be a matter of bringing the
    expansive information together in effective coding and presentation. I think
    the amount of work required would be intense, but I feel that it is feasibly
    possible and something that can help change the world. I am willing to
    give it a try, at the very least.</p>
  <p>I intend to increase my mastery in programming while studying and continuing
    afterwards through personal projects and contracting, and hopefully get a
    lot of practice with software design as I go too. It’s definitely an important
    idea to me, so I believe as long as I continue making an effort I’ll get to a
    point where I might actually make it.</p>
  <p>If the project is successful - which in this case would be: software has been
    developed, industry leaders are on board, the government turn it into an
    education initiative, and adoption rates are high – then I believe it will
    have an incredible effect on the future economy of the country. We will have
    more interested and upskilled students which would result in lower
    unemployment rates, and a more self-sufficient workforce that can operate
    without outsourcing industry roles internationally.</p>
  <p>In the end, I just want the generations to come to be as prepared as
    possible for the time that will come for them to become the leaders of a
    new world. I think that with the amount of distractions that exist in the
    technological world today, the answer is finding a way to make the
    distractions more productive, and providing an application like this is
    just one way I think we could do that.</p>
