  <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>

  <br>
  <p>This position as a software developer is with a company that proclaims
    itself the leaders in custom built virtual and augmented reality applications,
    which sounds exactly like the kind of work I was interested in exploring.
    The idea of working with a company with goals that align with me own is a
    great position to have available.</p>
  <p>The position itself is at a senior level, and would revolve around the
    process of developing, managing, and deploying effective applications. It
    looks to also act as a leadership position, which would be a position I
    hope to achieve on this path.</p>
  <p>Six years industry experience is mandatory to be considered, as well as
    tertiary qualifications, and existing clean code to show. Unity and C# are
    the primary requests regarding tool/language proficiency at a minimum.
    Unsurprisingly, Git is an essential request too.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am new to the industry, have yet to complete my degree, and
    am lacking in programming language knowledge. However, I do have talent in
    leadership and project management, and believe I can handle deployment
    better than most would for a position such as this. I think if I could work
    through six years in the industry, I would be in a good standing to take a
    position like this.</p>
  <p>In order to make up the desirable traits for a role like this, I plan to
    spend the next three years devoting as much time as I can to mastering
    relevant subjects and getting myself into the industry as soon as possible.
    Even when I find myself working in the industry, I am very interested in
    developing my own portfolio of code of software. I intend to work on personal
    projects throughout the next decade to build a solid foundation of ability
    and reputation, and hopefully make a name for myself as a contributor towards
    the future of technology.</p>
