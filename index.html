  <h1>Niki Arrogante - Profile</h1>
  <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Me">
  <p>Hello! My name is Niki Arrogante, student number: s3851498. My email
    address is s3851498@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
  <p>I was born and raised in Australia after my parents migrated from the
    Philippines around thirty years ago. I completed my high school education
    in 2006 then immediately entered the workforce to help support my family.
    During my school years I was a high performer, and an active member of the
    student representative council as a vice captain. Unfortunately, my father
    passed away early in his life during my high school years, so I put my
    chance to go to university aside to keep the household afloat.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy a range of hobbies, but my passions are with
    music, motorbikes, and gaming. At one point I was hoping to become a
    musician-producer, but life has a habit of carrying you in other directions.
    Instead, I floated through some odd jobs here and there aimlessly for a
    few years trying to work out what I wanted in life. After having my wonderful
    daughter, I realised that I needed to rekindle my passion for learning
    and go back to school.</p>
  <p>After discussing it with my partner, I left my steady 9-to-5 job and
    enrolled to study a Bachelor's in Information Technology, with the
    intention of swapping our household roles so that I could focus on studying,
    and take over once I've gained the skills I need to become a successful
    professional in the IT field.</p>
  <p>As a youth, my father was very involved in keeping me up to date with rising
    technologies. As such, my childhood was spent with electronic games, computer
    parts, and old Microsoft OS builds (hello Windows NT!). My love for all
    technology only grew, but I never really considered it as an interest in
    IT specifically. Late last year I had finally brought my life to a place
    where going back to study was financially plausible, but I hadn't decided
    exactly where I would go. Around this time, I bought myself an Oculus Rift
    S, a final splurge before I cut off my steady income. From the moment
    I had used it, I felt a nostalgic rush that reminded me of the fascination
    of playing video games as a child. I realised then a career in IT would be
    a good place for me, where I could try to bring this feeling to other people
    too.</p>
  <p>RMIT was recommended to me when I made my call to Open Universities. My
    advisor advocated their reputation and reviews seemed to be generally
    favourable. So RMIT ended up being my first choice.</p>
  <p>My goals are to learn more about programming and the industry, in hopes
    of working in software development. Specifically, I hope to develop virtual
    reality programs in the future and be part of the movement in making VR a
    mainstream consumer product.</p>
